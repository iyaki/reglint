# Core Architecture

## Overview

### Purpose

- Define the core architectural building blocks for the RegLint CLI.
- Establish clear module boundaries, data flow, and extension points.

### Goals

- Keep the scanning engine deterministic and reproducible across platforms.
- Make output generation pluggable across multiple formats.
- Separate configuration, scanning, and rendering concerns.
- Ensure the core can be reused by future integrations (e.g., editor plugins, alternative CI consumers).

### Non-Goals

- No long-running daemon or network service.
- No persistence layer or database.
- No UI beyond CLI output.

### Scope

- Local filesystem scanning using YAML rules.
- CLI execution path only.

```

### Data flow summary

1. CLI parses flags and resolves scan roots.
2. YAML config is loaded and validated.
3. Rules compile to RE2 regexes with normalized severity.
4. Analyze assembles deterministic scan hooks for the run.
5. Optional Git hooks resolve candidate files and added-line constraints when Git mode is enabled.
6. ScanService builds a request and starts the scan.
7. Engine walks files, applies filters (including hook augmentations), and matches rules.
8. Optional baseline comparator filters matches to regressions.
9. Optional baseline writer emits canonical baseline from full findings when regeneration mode is enabled.
10. Results are rendered by output writers.

## Data model

### Core Entities

ScanRequest

- Definition: Input to the scan service.
- Fields: roots, rules, include/exclude, maxFileSizeBytes, concurrency, optional git constraints, output formats.

Match

- Definition: Single rule match with location and severity.
- Fields: message, severity, filePath, line, column, matchText.

ScanResult

- Definition: Aggregated output for JSON/SARIF writers.
- Fields: matches, stats.

### Relationships

- CLI builds ScanRequest.
- ScanService produces ScanResult.
- Baseline comparator optionally transforms ScanResult before rendering.
- Output writers consume ScanResult.

### Persistence Notes

- No persistence.

## Workflows

### CLI run (happy path)

1. User runs `reglint --rules <file> [path ...]`.
2. Config loader validates YAML and compiles rules.
3. ScanService scans files with engine.
4. Output writers render console and optional JSON/SARIF.
5. Exit code reflects `--fail-on` threshold.

### Error cases

- Invalid YAML or regex: fail fast with exit code 1.
- Output write failure: exit code 1.
- File read error: record skipped and continue.
- Git adapter/runtime failures: fatal only when Git mode is explicitly enabled.
- Hook execution failures: fatal only when corresponding optional hook provider is active.

## APIs

- No network APIs. CLI is the public interface.

## Client SDK Design

- Not exposed publicly. Internal scanning service may be extracted later.

## Configuration

- RuleSet schema and global defaults are defined in `specs/configuration.md`.
- Rule schema, message templates, and severity mapping are defined in `specs/regex-rules.md`.

## Permissions

- No auth or roles.

## Security Considerations

- RE2 regex prevents catastrophic backtracking.
- Skip large or binary files to avoid resource abuse.
- Treat match text as sensitive in logs.
- Git-assisted scope selection must avoid exposing match content in Git-related errors.

## Dependencies

- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
- `github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar/v4`
- `github.com/owenrumney/go-sarif/v2/sarif`
- `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`
- Git CLI executable (runtime, only for Git-enabled analyze runs)

## Open Questions / Risks

- Should we standardize output ordering at the engine or writer layer?
- Do we need optional redaction of match text for sensitive scans?

## Verifications

- Code builds and `make test` passes.
- CLI scan produces console, JSON, and SARIF outputs.

## Appendices

- See `specs/configuration.md` and `specs/regex-rules.md` for configuration details and `specs/data-model.md` for output schemas.
- Git-specific hook behavior and contracts are defined in `specs/git-integration.md`.
